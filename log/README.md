# README : log
This folder is for project logs.

You are required to make a weekly log and commit it to this folder. The weekly logs are due at **Saturday midnight**. Late logs are not accepted and will marked as NHI. Any commits past the deadline will not be marked.

The weekly logs are to be written using markdown and have to be saved using the following file name convention: ```week1.md```, ```week2.md```, etc.

Your weekly log messages have to describe in detail your progress over the last week and include the following headings.

1. What did you learn this week?
2. What did you make/create?
3. Epic Failures of the Week
4. Goal for Next Week
5. Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?

# Keep in Mind...
* Your of messages have to use [proper Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
* Since your log entries (together with your commits) will account for 50% of your final mark you need to put great effort into your log messages (and commits). 
* Log entries have to be detailed, specific, accurate and use correct English language conventions and spelling. Typos and sloppy log entries are not acceptable and will result in deductions. 
* As a guideline, aim for at least two paragraphs per heading. Have someone proof read and give feedback on your log entry before the deadline passes. 
* You can work on your logs (fixing errors, typos, and imnproving them) until the deadline. Any commits after the deadline will be ignored and the commit closest to the deadline will marked.
