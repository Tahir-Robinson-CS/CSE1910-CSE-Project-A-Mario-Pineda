# README : CSE1910 - CSE Project A

**This repository is a clone of [CSE1910-CSE-Project-A](https://github.com/mariopineda/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A) and is an exemplar of a major project developed by Dr. Pineda. This is not the template repository you would fork to set up the project repository for your own major project. The template repository is [CSE1910-CSE-Project-A](https://github.com/mariopineda/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A).**

**Remember that this project is worth 1 full credit (CSE1910: CSE Project A). Complete all the basic requirements FIRST before progressing to the extras.**

## Time Line
Note: all deadlines are at the end of Friday class.

Week 1: Nov 25 - Dec 2

Week 2: Dec 3 - Dec 9

Week 3: Dec 10 - Dec 16

Week 4: Dec 17 - Dec 23

Week 5: Dec 24 - Jan 13

## Expectations
In this assignment you will use project-based learning to connect and extend your previous learning in computer science. Take this assignment as a learning experience, not an easy grade. Your success will suffer if you do not sincerely pursue a project that interests you.

## Project Selection
While you have freedom in selecting your project based on your interests (i.e. you have lots of freedom when choosing a project) your project has to fullfill all the following criteria:

* You must be passionate about your project
* Result in a final product (software, hardware, digital resource, etc.) 
* You must able to access it at school every day for the rest of the class (physically and/or virtually)
* Connect to topics and concepts covered in Computer Science 10
* Using git and GitHub for source control management
* Cannot consist of only binaries
* Legal to develop and use 
* Must be safe for you and for the user

## Collaborative Projects
Collaborative projects are approved on an individual basis and require all the students in the group to have shown mastery of git/GitHub concepts and workflow. Talk to your teacher if you are considering a collaborative project.

## Evaluation
The following components of the major project are evaluated:

1. Pitch (10%)
2. Proposal (10%)
3. Log entries and source control management (50%)
4. Presentation (20%)
5. Final product (10%)

## Keeping up to date with the master repository
To keep your local assignment repository up to date with your teacher's repository you need to issue the following commands from the terminal:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mariopineda/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

The first time you are updating your local assignment repository you need to run all three commands, subsequent updates will only require the second and third command.

Once you have merged your version of the repository with your teacher's version do: ```git pull```. Check if there are any conflicts (if they are you have to fix them manually) and finish by committing (```commit```) and pushing (```push```).

## Building Web Pages
This repository has been set up with a web page template. To access the source code for the web page template you need to change the current working branch to the gh-pages. You can access the web site through the browser at http://mariopineda.github.io/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A/.
